			<h4>Biodata</h4>
			<p class="text-start">
			I am a Professor of Mathematics (and The Michael and Eugenia Brin Endowed E-Nnovate Chair in
			Mathematics) at the Department of Mathematics, University of Maryland, College Park. My research
			work focuses on using mathematical approaches (modeling, rigorous analysis, and data analytics) to gain
			insight and provide understanding on the transmission dynamics of emerging and re-emerging
			infectious diseases of public health significance. Specifically, I design, analyze, parameterize, and
			simulate novel models for the transmission dynamics and control of emerging and re-emerging
			infectious diseases. My research also involves the qualitative theory of nonlinear dynamical systems
			arising in the mathematical modeling of phenomena in population biology (ecology, epidemiology,
			immunology etc.) and computational mathematics (with emphasis on the design of robust numerical
			methods that give results that are dynamically-consistent with the governing continuous-time model
			being discretized). The ultimate objective of my research work, in addition to the development of
			advanced (and perhaps novel) mathematical theory and methodologies for studying nonlinear
			dynamical systems arising in population biology, is to contribute to the development of effective public
			health policy for controlling and mitigating the burden of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

			<p class="text-start">I am a mathematical biologist, who specialize in designing, rigorously analyzing and parameterizing
				novel mathematical models for gaining insight and understanding on the transmission dynamics and
				control of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases of public health significance. My team and I
				have addressed research questions pertaining to the mathematics of the ecology, epidemiology
				and immunology of some infectious diseases of humans and other animals. We are currently
				focused on the following research questions and/or projects:
			</p>
			<ul id="research-questions">
				<li>
					What is the impact of anthropogenic climate and environmental changes on the global
					burden and distribution of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika and
					West Nile virus?
				</li>
				<li>
					Is there a connection between insecticide resistance and malaria epidemiology? This
					entails designing a novel genomic-epidemiology framework for malaria transmission
					dynamics in a population, where the malaria vector (Anopheles mosquitoes) are stratified
					according to genotype.
				</li>
				<li>
					What is the impact of land use changes and human mobility on the global burden and
					distribution of infectious diseases?	
				</li>
				<li>
					Mathematics of the One Health Initiative … where public health is viewed holistically
					within the human-animal-environment nexus. This is critical in using mathematical
					approaches to predict the likelihood, and effective control and mitigation, of major
					disease outbreaks and pandemics.
				</li>
				<li>
					Assessment of nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical control and mitigation strategies
					against human and other animal diseases of major public health significance.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="text-start">
				The mathematical models we design are often of the form of deterministic systems of nonlinear
				differential equations (ordinary, partial or functional). We use or develop dynamical systems
				theories and methodologies for studying the qualitative dynamics of these models, aimed at
				determining, in parameter space, conditions for the persistence or effective control of the
				diseases being modeled. Specifically, we are interested in proving theorems for the existence
				and asymptotic stability of the steady-state solutions of the models, and in characterizing the
				associated bifurcation types. Statistics play a major role in our research work. We specifically
				use optimization and inverse problem approaches to fit models to data, estimate unknown
				parameters (needed for model validation and cross-validation), make predictions and carry out
				global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for the parameters of the models. Our work also
				involves some computational component. The nonlinearity and large dimensionality of the
				models we often deal with necessitate the use of robust numerical discretization approaches to
				find approximations of their solutions. We are specifically interested in designing numerical
				methods that are dynamical-consistent (i.e., preserve the essential physical properties) of the
				governing continuous-time models being discretized.
